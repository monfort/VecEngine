<p>VecEngine is a library for creating and editing two-dimensional vector graphics (like Adobe Illustrator, FreeHand, CorelDraw...)<br>It is built as an MFC/C++ library (uses Win32 API).</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Create and manipulate different types of graphic objects</li>
<li>Various types of object transformation</li>
<li>Grouping, locking, auto align / distribute, Z order</li>
<li>Grid, Guide, Rulers. (with support for snapping)</li>
<li>Embedding / cropping Images</li>
<li>Embedding / cropping Text</li>
<li>Color (foreground / background), line style (e.g. dashed), fill pattern, transparency and translucency, drop shadow</li>
